*Purpose* 

The purpose of this R program is to analyze website performance based on two data sets. This program will produce a series of time trend figures, pie charts, and box plots that can be used to help visualize website performance. 


*Directory Structure:*

This directory is organized with the following folder structure. 
- "Programs" folder will house all relevant R code used to produce the figures.
- "Data" folder will house the source data set, intermediate data sets produced for the analysis,and the final deliverable xlsx workbook
- "Results" folder will house the slide deck presentation and all relevant figures created. For the sake of time and simplicity I chose to utilize power point to create the slide deck. To avoid input error as figures and analysis is updated, I would typically use beamer from latex to produce power points. 
- "hlpr func" folder will house all helper functions created to run the analysis 

*Procedures:*

To run the program, start by running the 00_Prologue.R script. This will set your working directory folder structure. Proceed through each R script in chronological order. R scripts given the same superscript are independent and can be run in the order of the users choosing. E.g., 02_historical data exploration.R can be ran before 02_historical metric analysis.R or vice versa.
